## About Me

I'm passionate about building tools that make AI development more accessible and reliable. At Vellum, I focus on 
creating platforms that help both developers and non-developers leverage the power of large language models (LLMs) in
their applications.

## Tech Stack

**Languages & Frameworks:**
- Python, TypeScript, React
- Django, Redux Toolkit
- Material-UI (MUI)

**Infrastructure & Tools:**
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Kubernetes (k8s)
- AI/ML platforms and tooling

## Articles & Writing

I occasionally write about my experiences in AI tooling and software development:

- [Using Coding Agents to Upgrade Major Library Versions in Hours, Not Weeks](./articles/Using%20Coding%20Agents%20to%20Upgrade%20Major%20Library%20Versions%20in%20Hours%2C%20Not%20Weeks.md) - How I used AI coding agents to tackle a complex library migration that would have taken weeks manually.
